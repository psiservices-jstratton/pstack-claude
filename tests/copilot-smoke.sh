# GitHub Copilot install smoke test for the pstack plugin.
#
# Installs this checkout into a throwaway COPILOT_HOME, with HOME also pointed at
# a throwaway directory so a stray write to a literal ~/.copilot path cannot reach
# the real one (sign-in lives in the system keychain, not HOME), and
# proves, from each session's events.jsonl rather than the model's say-so:
#   1. the marketplace install reports every skill directory
#   2. the SessionStart hook injects the routing mandate as JSON additionalContext
#   3. `session hook: off` in the Copilot sheet suppresses it
#   4. both plugin agents register, and a pstack:poteto-agent dispatch with an
#      explicit model runs on that model
#   5. with no model sheet, a multi-model skill runs setup-pstack first
#   6. setup-pstack writes no sheet without answers, and exactly the supplied IDs
#   7. without --allow-all-paths, and with the temp dir outside the sandbox, the
#      saved model choices reach the session with no read of the sheet, and a
#      plugin playbook loads, with no path-access request at all
#   8. the PreToolUse hook denies a pstack:* task call on an off-sheet model and
#      a create that would write a malformed sheet, and runs a vendored script
#      with no --allow-all-tools and no permission request
#   9. a second plugin's sessionStart context reaches the model next to pstack's
#      (github/copilot-cli#3589)
#  10. a -p resume fires the hook again with source "resume"
#  11. interactive, through tests/copilot-tui.py: a slash command as the first
#      message gets the routing context on that turn, and an interactive resume
#      keeps exactly one routing block
#  12. opt-in, SMOKE_GITHUB=owner/repo@ref: checks 7 and 8's script run again on
#      a GitHub marketplace install under $COPILOT_HOME/installed-plugins
#
# Needs the `copilot` CLI signed in, `jq`, and network, and python3 for check
# 11 (skipped without it). Each probe is one short session, about 20 premium
# requests in all with the defaults. Skips with exit 0 when `copilot` is
