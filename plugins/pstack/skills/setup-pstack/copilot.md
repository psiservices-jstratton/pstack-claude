# Setup pstack on GitHub Copilot

On GitHub Copilot this file replaces the questions in steps 1, 3, and 4 of [setup-pstack](SKILL.md). Steps 2 and 5 through 8 still apply. pstack ships no Copilot model defaults, so every model in the sheet comes from the user's answers.

## Asking

Copilot's `ask_user` takes one question per call with a fixed choice list. That list is a `choices` list, or one `oneOf` string property of a `requestedSchema` where `ask_user` takes an elicitation form. Its UI adds a free-text option on its own. Treat it as single-select, because the Copilot app's `ask_user` has no multi-select. Ask every model question through `ask_user` with a `choices` list. Never ask for models as one open question, such as which roles should change and to what, and never bundle two questions into one call. Emulate multi-select with sequential single-select questions, as the panel slots below do.

- Do not propose, pre-select, or label any model `(Recommended)`. A first setup has no default to recommend.
- On a re-run, put step 2's saved value for the question first, labeled `(current)`. Picking it keeps that value.
- A typed answer counts only when it is a detected model ID or `inherit-parent`; otherwise ask the same question again.
- An answer the user already gave in the request counts. Ask only the questions it leaves open.
- When `ask_user` is not available (a `-p` run, or `--no-ask-user`) and a model question is still open, do not choose for the user and do not write the sheet. Tell the user to run `setup-pstack` in an interactive session, and run this session's roles as `inherit-parent`.

## Current state and writing

On Copilot, step 2's saved values are the saved pstack model choices the plugin hook put in context. When the context says this Copilot home has no pstack model sheet yet, there are none. Read the sheet only when neither is in context, as in a skills-only install. Do not test for the sheet or its directory with `bash`. Each such command touches a path outside the workspace and asks for access. `${COPILOT_HOME:-~/.copilot}` exists whenever Copilot runs. Write the sheet in one tool call, `create` for a new sheet or one `bash` heredoc that replaces a saved one, so the write asks for path access at most once.

## Detect models

The detected set is the `model` enum of the `task` tool, with full IDs exactly as the enum lists them. Never shorten one to a family name. If this session has no `task` tool or its enum is not visible, write `inherit-parent` for every role, skip the model questions, and tell the user to rerun `setup-pstack` in a session with the `task` tool. The Claude Code names in [Models](SKILL.md#models) and the values in step 6's sheet shape are not Copilot model IDs; never write them into a Copilot sheet.

Group the detected IDs by vendor, from each ID's text before its first hyphen. `claude` is Claude, `gpt` is GPT, `gemini` is Gemini, `grok` is Grok, `kimi` is Kimi, and any other ID is Other. Keep the enum's order within a vendor.

## Choosing one model

Each model question below picks one value in two `ask_user` calls, so no choices list holds the whole enum:

1. **Vendor.** One choice per vendor with its model count, such as `GPT (12 models)`, then `inherit-parent (run on the session's model)`. A vendor with a single model shows that model's ID instead, and picking it ends the question.
2. **Model.** That vendor's IDs, then `Back to vendors`.

When the detected set plus `inherit-parent` is 8 choices or fewer, skip the vendor step and list every ID in one question. `auto` means the same as `inherit-parent` in pstack, so it is not a separate choice; a saved `auto` shows as `auto (current)` on a re-run.

## Question sequence

Ask in this order. Each model question is the vendor and model pair above; every other question is one `ask_user` call.

1. **Default model.** "Default model: runs feature and refactoring work, judgment and prose, the how explorer and explainer, the why investigators and synthesizer, reflect, and swarm workers." It writes `feature, refactoring`, `judgment and prose`, `how explorer`, `how explainer`, `why investigators`, `why synthesizer`, `reflect tooling`, `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer`, and `swarm workers`.
2. **Strongest model.** "Strongest model: runs bug-fix, perf-issue, hillclimb, and strongest judgment." It writes `bug-fix`, `perf-issue`, `hillclimb`, and `strongest judgment`.
3. **Panel model 1 of 3**, then **panel model 2 of 3**, then **panel model 3 of 3**, as three separate questions. "Panel model N of 3: panels run one subagent per model, and models from different vendors catch different mistakes." In slots 2 and 3, list the vendors not yet in the panel first, then the rest, then `inherit-parent`. Do not offer a model already in the panel.
4. **More panel models.** "Add a 4th panel model?" with `Done` as the first choice and `Add a 4th` second. Adding asks one more slot the same way, then asks again for a 5th. Stop offering at 5 models.
5. **Vendor check.** When every panel model is from one vendor and more than one vendor is detected, ask "The panel is single-vendor (Claude), so its cross-checks share blind spots." with `Pick the panel again` and `Keep it anyway`. Picking again returns to panel model 1. When only one vendor is detected, skip this question and say in step 8 that the panel's diversity is reduced.
6. **Overrides.** "Override any individual role?" with `No, write the sheet (Recommended)` first, then one choice per group: `feature, refactoring`, `judgment and prose`, `how explorer and explainer`, `why investigators and synthesizer`, `reflect roles`, `swarm workers`, `bug-fix, perf-issue, hillclimb`, `strongest judgment`, and `a panel role`. Show each group's value in its label, as `swarm workers (<its model ID>)`. A group asks one model as in [Choosing one model](#choosing-one-model), with its value first as `(current)`, and writes that value to every role in the group. `a panel role` first asks which of `arena runners`, `arena cross-judge pool`, `architect runners`, and `interrogate reviewers`, then asks that list's slots as in questions 3 through 5. After each override, ask this question again, until the answer is `No, write the sheet`.
7. **Session hook.** "Keep the session hook that routes tasks to poteto-mode?" with `On (default)` and `Off`. On a re-run, the saved value comes first as `(current)`.

The panel from questions 3 through 5 writes `arena runners`, `arena cross-judge pool`, `architect runners`, and `interrogate reviewers`, in slot order. On a re-run, the saved value for question 1 is the `feature, refactoring` line, for question 2 the `bug-fix` line, and for panel model N the Nth entry of `arena runners`. A role whose saved value differs from its question's saved value keeps it, and question 6 shows it.

Then validate and write the sheet as steps 5 and 6 describe, and show the written role lines in step 8.
