# pstack

Lauren Tan's [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) is an opinionated Cursor skill stack that improves agent outcomes. This is a faithful port for Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot and other agent harnesses.

Tell `poteto-mode` your goal and it will invoke the correct workflow for the task. It keeps your code concise, simple and verified.

## Install

### Claude Code

Run in Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add michael-denyer/pstack-claude
/plugin install pstack@pstack-claude
```

### Codex

Run in your terminal:

```shell
codex plugin marketplace add michael-denyer/pstack-claude
codex plugin add pstack@pstack-claude
```

### GitHub Copilot

Run in your terminal:

```shell
copilot plugin marketplace add michael-denyer/pstack-claude
copilot plugin install pstack@pstack-claude
```

This installs pstack for the Copilot CLI and the GitHub Copilot app, which share `~/.copilot`. Start a new session afterwards. Copilot ships no default pstack models, so the first skill that needs one runs `setup-pstack` to pick from the models your account lists, and later sessions reuse that choice.

Run `setup-pstack` to change model defaults or turn automatic routing off. The plugin installs the routing hook on Claude Code, Codex, and GitHub Copilot; Codex asks you to trust it through `/hooks` before it runs. In Claude Code, use `/pstack:setup-pstack`.

For Prime Agent, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, or skills-only installs for any harness, see [shared installation](docs/reference.md#shared-skills-installation).

## Getting started

```text
Use poteto-mode to fix the search filter resetting when I change pages.
```

For a bug, it reproduces the failure, uses `how` and `why` to investigate, delegates the fix, then reruns the failing case. If the fix crosses a function boundary, it brings in `architect` before implementation. You receive the fix and the failing and passing evidence.

[Other playbooks](plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md#playbooks) cover planning, features, refactoring, performance issues, investigations, prototypes, PR maintenance, shipping, and longer projects.

![A request enters poteto-mode. Playbook options include Plan, Bugs, Features, and Refactor. Planning can use architect, arena, or swarm; review and verification can use interrogate, tests, and measurements. Supporting skills include how, why, and unslop. The output is Finished work validated.](assets/pstack-overview.png)
